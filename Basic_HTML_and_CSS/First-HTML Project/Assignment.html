				<q>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace is a 1999 American epic space opera film written and directed by George Lucas. 
				It stars Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ahmed Best, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, 
				Pernilla August, and Frank Oz. It is the fourth film in the Star Wars film series, the first film of the prequel trilogy and
				the first chronological chapter of the "Skywalker Saga". Set 32 years before the original trilogy, (13 years before the formation
				of the Galactic Empire), during the era of the Galactic Republic, the plot follows Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice 
				Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to protect Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo in hopes of securing a peaceful end to an interplanetary 
				trade dispute. Joined by Anakin Skywalker—a young slave with unusually strong natural powers of the Force—they simultaneously 
				contend with the mysterious return of the Sith. The film was produced by Lucasfilm and distributed by 20th Century Fox.</q>
